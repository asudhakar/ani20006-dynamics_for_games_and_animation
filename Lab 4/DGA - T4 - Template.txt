======================================================
# Resources Used
> List (with names/titles) any websites/links that you found useful/helpful - don’t include things like search engines

======================================================
# Task Details
## Scene/Video Description
> Describe what is going on in the video, in a literal sense (i.e. provide a text description of what is literally happening in the video as it plays).


## Optimisation and Performance
> How ‘heavy’ or ‘expensive’ do you think are the systems in what you were critiquing? Why are they heavy/light?


## Dynamic Systems
> Identify any dynamic systems you can see. This does not need to be 'accurate' to the original file (if the video is from another student): write what you might use yourself, to achieve the same result. Explain/justify.
> If applicable, discuss other potential systems that could be used as well.


## Forces, Movement, and Randomization
> Similar as above. Identify potential force objects that are used, or that you might use should you try to achieve the same result. Explain/justify.


## Physics Phenomena Discussion
> On a more theoretical level, identify and discuss physical phenomena that you think is being addressed (and how well/deeply it is being shown) in the video.
> Also identify what phenomena is not being addressed very well, that could/should be shown, or made more prominent.
> Reference links to footage/phenomena/wiki articles will be useful here too.
