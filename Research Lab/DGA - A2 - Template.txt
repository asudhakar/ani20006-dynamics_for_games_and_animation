## 1 - Overview and Pitch
TLDR: Atomic bomb and interaction with other objects in the scene (trees, cars, buildings, etc.)
Atomic Bomb:


## 2 - Research, Develop/Test
**22/04/2021:** Considered making an fx pack consisted of many small and simple fx's for a moveset, maybe for a fighting game. This purely came from a need for flexible project management. If the project output needs to be cut down for whatever reason (overscoping, unexpected challenges, etc.), then it's as easy as reducing the number of fx's required to create.
Outcome: [28 Firebending moves in Avatar](https://youtu.be/V0IdKWKt5dM)
Possible moves to recreate from first glance:
- Fire block 
- Fire stream
- Fire whip
- Fire jabs
- Shield of Fire
- Fire comet
- Fire missles
- Intertwined fire stream

**26/04/2021:** Realized going deep (ie. creating 1 complex fx) is better than going wide (ie. creating many simple fx's) for this project. Going wide provides opportunity to learn many new skills and concepts quicker, but going deep gives better quality for the final product in the context of this unit.

*How?*
Creating one fx with many layers of details requires a deep understanding of its underlying mechanics and the physical interactions between the components involved, which forces a thorough analysis of each component when studying the fx. 

*In the context of this unit?*
This unit focusses on recreating physically accurate fx's by evalutating a range of physics theories and simulation practices related to use as reference. So, by learning to create one complex fx rather than creating many simple fx's, it will help train my ability to break down an fx to its core, and the tiny details in the way each of the components interact with each other (which better corresponds to the goals of the unit), rather than training my skills in rapid development and ability to absorb a large amount of information. From there, I can hopefully show what I studied from that fx by simulating as much of it as possible (if not everything then at least the most important ones), rather than showing my ability to "roughly" recreate many small fx's in the same amount of time.

Doing this would still fulfill the need for flexible management, since layers of complexity can be dropped if the situation calls for it.

Outcome: Changed goal to recreating one big/complex fx, either an atomic bomb or a fire tornado.

**31/04/2021:** 

, but  atomic bomb fx and fire tornado fx, but I like going deep (creating one fx with many layers of details) more than going wide (creating many simple fx).

and creating the nuke fx has a lot more layers for details (ie. shockwave, debris, even the mushroom cloud alone has many smaller components) than a fire tornado does (it's just a tornado on fire, not a lot can be added to give more depth)

- This time I wanna expand my knowledge with the rigidbody system. More specifically adding forces to the rigidbodies rather than just dealing with collision.
	- This would most likely be seen in objects flying + glass shattering when shockwave hits
Smokes plumes for mushroom cloud can either be made using smoke particle system + windzone (experimental) or mesh with shader with a height map

Outcome: Making nuke fx from perspective of the receiver rather from the attacker

## 3 - The Science Behind the Design
**Phase 1:** Initial explosion (happens in milliseconds)
- Flash + Rapidly expanding ball of plasma (roughly 2km in diameter)
	- Everything touched by it is evaporated (the ball is hotter than the sun in this stage)
- Everything flammable within 13km is burnt from the thermal pulse produced by the heat (plastic, wood, fabric, hair, skin, etc.)

**Phase 2:** The shockwave (happens in a few seconds)
- Heat and radiation from the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air that expands faster the the speed of sound, resulting in a shockwave
	- Dust clouds starts to appear here
	- Shockwave travels faster than the dust clouds
	- Buildings and structures within 1km are grounded
	- Buildings within 175km collapse
	- Gas stations explodes, spreading fire

**Phase 3:** The mushroom (happens in a few minutes)
- Made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash (glowing hot)
	- Condensation rings start to appear here from layers of humidity in the air (grows from center of the mushroom cloud outwards). Can only happen in warm, wet environments
	- Can pull smokes and fires from nearby rubbles towards the center
- Shockwave still travels during this time
- Can last up to 10min
