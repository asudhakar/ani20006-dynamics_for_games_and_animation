> See task sheet (Section 3) for details on each section

## 1 - Overview and Pitch
TLDR: Atomic bomb and interaction with other objects in the scene (trees, cars, buildings, etc.)
Atomic Bomb:


## 2 - Research, Develop/Test


## 3 - The Science Behind the Design
**Phase 1:** Initial explosion (happens in milliseconds)
- Flash + Rapidly expanding ball of plasma (roughly 2km in diameter)
	- Everything touched by it is evaporated (the ball is hotter than the sun in this stage)
- Everything flammable within 13km is burnt from the thermal pulse produced by the heat (plastic, wood, fabric, hair, skin, etc.)

**Phase 2:** The shockwave (happens in a few seconds)
- Heat and radiation from the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air that expands faster the the speed of sound, resulting in a shockwave
	- Dust clouds starts to appear here
	- Shockwave travels faster than the dust clouds
	- Buildings and structures within 1km are grounded
	- Buildings within 175km collapse
	- Gas stations explodes, spreading fire

**Phase 3:** The mushroom (happens in a few minutes)
- Made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash (glowing hot)
	- Condensation rings start to appear here from layers of humidity in the air (grows from center of the mushroom cloud outwards). Can only happen in warm, wet environments
	- Can pull smokes and fires from nearby rubbles towards the center
- Shockwave still travels during this time
- Can last up to 10min
