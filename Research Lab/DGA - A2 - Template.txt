## 1 - Overview and Pitch
TLDR: Atomic bomb and interaction with other objects in the scene (trees, cars, buildings, etc.)
Atomic Bomb:


## 2 - Research, Develop/Test
**22/04/2021:** Considered making an fx pack consisted of many small and simple fx's for a moveset, maybe for a fighting game. This purely came from a need for flexible project management. If the project output needs to be cut down for whatever reason (overscoping, unexpected challenges, etc.), then it's as easy as reducing the number of fx's required to create.
Outcome: [28 Firebending moves in Avatar](https://youtu.be/V0IdKWKt5dM)
Possible moves to recreate from first glance:
- Fire block 
- Fire stream
- Fire whip
- Fire jabs
- Shield of Fire
- Fire comet
- Fire missles
- Intertwined fire stream

**26/04/2021:** Realized going deep (ie. creating 1 complex fx) is better than going wide (ie. creating many simple fx's) for this project. Going wide provides opportunity to learn many new skills and concepts quicker, but going deep gives better quality for the final product in the context of this unit.

*How?*
Creating one fx with many layers of details requires a deep understanding of its underlying mechanics and the physical interactions between the components involved, which forces a thorough analysis of each component when studying the fx. 

*In the context of this unit?*
This unit focusses on recreating physically accurate fx's by evalutating a range of physics theories and simulation practices related to use as reference. So, by learning to create one complex fx rather than creating many simple fx's, it will help train my ability to break down an fx to its core, and the tiny details in the way each of the components interact with each other (which better corresponds to the goals of the unit), rather than training my skills in rapid development and ability to absorb a large amount of information. From there, I can hopefully show what I studied from that fx by simulating as much of it as possible (if not everything then at least the most important ones), rather than showing my ability to "roughly" recreate many small fx's in the same amount of time.

Doing this would still fulfill the need for flexible management, since layers of complexity can be dropped if the situation calls for it.

Outcome: Changed goal to recreating one big/complex fx, either an atomic bomb or a fire tornado. Specifics in terms of interactions and complexity are currently unknown.

**30/04/2021:** Collected images and video references for both nuke and tornado. Decided that nuke is the prettier option.

**05/05/2021:** Decided to expand my knowledge with the rigidbody system. More specifically adding forces to the rigidbodies and dealing with explosion fx, rather than just dealing with collision. This would be best demonstrated in showing objects flying/breaking when the shockwave coming from the nuke hits.

Outcome: Making nuke fx from perspective of the receiver rather from the attacker. [Something similar to this.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EarnestPerfectIberianlynx-mobile.mp4)
*Note:* This will result in the explosion being seen from further away than if it was observed from a military plane dropping it. So less detail is required to show for the nuke, and more for the object being affected by the explosion.
## 3 - The Science Behind the Design
**1. FX Breakdown**

**Phase 1:** The explosion (happens in milliseconds)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713735780412948554/840894042777714748/unknown.png)
- Flash + Rapidly expanding ball of plasma (roughly 2km in diameter)
	- Everything touched by it is evaporated (the ball is hotter than the sun in this stage)
- Everything flammable within 13km is burnt from the thermal pulse produced by the heat (plastic, wood, fabric, hair, skin, etc.)

**Phase 2:** The shockwave (happens in a few seconds)
![Slow Motion Shots Of A Large Explosion With A Visible Shock Wave High-Res  Stock Video Footage - Getty Images](https://media.gettyimages.com/videos/slow-motion-shots-of-a-large-explosion-with-a-visible-shock-wave-video-id511075590?s=640x640)
- Heat and radiation from the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air that expands faster the the speed of sound, resulting in a shockwave
	- Moisture condensation distorts the camera
	- Dust clouds starts to appear here
	- Shockwave travels much faster than the dust clouds
	- Buildings and structures within 1km are grounded
	- Buildings within 175km collapse
	- Gas stations explodes, spreading fire

**Phase 3:** The mushroom (happens in a few minutes)
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713735780412948554/840893209767837706/unknown.png)
- Made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash (glowing hot)
	- Condensation rings start to appear here from layers of humidity in the air (grows from center of the mushroom cloud outwards). The more warm + wet the environment, the more rings will appear
	- Can pull smokes and fires from nearby rubbles towards the center after the 2nd phase
	- Over time, the center of the cap would still be glowing, but the outside would cool down to a combination of light grey and dark grey
- Shockwave still travels during this time
- Cloud can last up to 10min

**Distance from camera to nuke:** 
A building needs to be far enough (seems to be >175km) from the blast zone, so that the effect from a nuclear explosion can still be felt without being completely pulverized. This is necessary since the observer inside would need to survive the blast with little damage, so little camera work and animation is required (the central focus is the fx and the way the objects in the buildings behave to the blast, less so how the observer reacts to it).
The explosion will look very similar to this: [Eye-level perspective of a nuke exploding.](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EarnestPerfectIberianlynx-mobile.mp4)

**Place of occurence:** 
A place that has no people and little to no environmental props (easy scene construction), but can still have a house - a desert. The Tsar Bomba exploded in a desert in the Artic, and produced 2 condensation rings. So the amount of rings produced by this nuke should be the same +/-1 (compensation for inaccruacies in simulation).

Tsar Bomba exploding

======================================================
**3. Special considerations**
Nuke
- The explosion would just be a flash. Since the initial stage happens so quickly and from so far away, it's very hard to see clearly what the ball of plasma looks like.
- The shockwave as of right now would just be an invisible force affecting objects around the scene (it's more important to simulate the fx of the shockwave better than making it look visually accurate). If there's still time during the post processing stage, the camera distortion fx will be added.
- The mushroom cloud will consist of the expanding dust cloud, the rising stem, and the swirling mushroom cap. 2 condensation rings will be produced from the blast. The cloud will last the entire duration of the demonstration.

- If the building's integrity is too weak, or the building's placed too close to the explosion that it would collapse in realife, there's no way to know for sure without going into too much unecessary details. So, for the purpose of demonstration, the building will not collapse or show any signs of *major* damage (ie. the most would be dust falling and window shattering, but the actual walls will not crack or break).

## 4 - Production Plan
Smokes plumes for mushroom cloud can either be made using smoke particle system + windzone (experimental) or mesh with shader with a height map
