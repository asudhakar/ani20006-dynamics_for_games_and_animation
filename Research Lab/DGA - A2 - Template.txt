## 1 - Overview and Pitch
TLDR: Atomic bomb and interaction with other objects in the scene (trees, cars, buildings, etc.)
Atomic Bomb:


## 2 - Research, Develop/Test
**22/03/2021:** Considered making an fx pack consisted of many small and simple fx's for a moveset (ie. avatar fire bending)
Possible moves to recreate from first glance: [28 Firebending moves in Avatar](https://youtu.be/V0IdKWKt5dM)

- Fire block 
- Fire stream
- Fire whip
- Fire jabs
- Shield of Fire
- Fire comet
- Fire missles
- Intertwined fire stream

**26/03/2021:** Realized going deep is better than going wide for this project. Going wide provides opportunity to learn many new skills and concepts quicker, but going deep allows better control over quality of the final product. In other words, going deep forces a more thorough analysis of the one fx being recreated, allowing for a much deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of the fx than going wide can provide. Doing this will result in a more complex fx for the final product than going wide can under the same time constraints. This unit focusses on recreating physically accurate fx's by evalutating a range of physics theories and simulation practices related to it. So, creating an fx with many layers of complexity seems to be the more desirable method since it will help train my awareness to the tiny nuances in the interaction of the different components of the fx, and from that, hopefully be able to simulate said interactions in my final product.

Outcome: Changed goal to recreating an atomic bomb and a fire tornado

, but  atomic bomb fx and fire tornado fx, but I like going deep (creating one fx with many layers of details) more than going wide (creating many simple fx).

Going deep allows for more control over the quality of the final product (ie. if it's close to the deadline and I'm only ), while going wide makes learning many new concepts faster, but will also takes more time to complete

and creating the nuke fx has a lot more layers for details (ie. shockwave, debris, even the mushroom cloud alone has many smaller components) than a fire tornado does (it's just a tornado on fire, not a lot can be added to give more depth)

- This time I wanna expand my knowledge with the rigidbody system. More specifically adding forces to the rigidbodies rather than just dealing with collision.
	- This would most likely be seen in objects flying + glass shattering when shockwave hits
Smokes plumes for mushroom cloud can either be made using smoke particle system + windzone (experimental) or mesh with shader with a height map



## 3 - The Science Behind the Design
**Phase 1:** Initial explosion (happens in milliseconds)
- Flash + Rapidly expanding ball of plasma (roughly 2km in diameter)
	- Everything touched by it is evaporated (the ball is hotter than the sun in this stage)
- Everything flammable within 13km is burnt from the thermal pulse produced by the heat (plastic, wood, fabric, hair, skin, etc.)

**Phase 2:** The shockwave (happens in a few seconds)
- Heat and radiation from the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air that expands faster the the speed of sound, resulting in a shockwave
	- Dust clouds starts to appear here
	- Shockwave travels faster than the dust clouds
	- Buildings and structures within 1km are grounded
	- Buildings within 175km collapse
	- Gas stations explodes, spreading fire

**Phase 3:** The mushroom (happens in a few minutes)
- Made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash (glowing hot)
	- Condensation rings start to appear here from layers of humidity in the air (grows from center of the mushroom cloud outwards). Can only happen in warm, wet environments
	- Can pull smokes and fires from nearby rubbles towards the center
- Shockwave still travels during this time
- Can last up to 10min
